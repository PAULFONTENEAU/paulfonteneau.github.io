  For a rehabilitation project, I had to redraw, with a team, an entire building, part of which would be demolished, and an extension would be created using REVIT.

## Building réhabilitation

> The project.

The project involved rehabilitating a building in Gradignan. Specifically, the site was to be transformed into a co-living space for a school. A portion of the existing building would be demolished to make way for an extension containing an auditorium. As project managers, our initial task was to create the BIM convention, following the BIM charter provided by the client. This convention included various stakeholders, the BIM level to be used with the LOAD level, as well as deadlines, deliverables, etc. Among the deliverables were a 4D 5D schedule, as well as numerous sections, plan views, elevations, realistic renderings, a one-minute video to present the project, and an innovation to help the client better understand the future work..

> How we do ?

We divided the work among ourselves, with each person modeling a part of the building. We took care to use subprojects (such as "structure") and worked with BIM Level 2, meaning we didn't have a single model but federated models, facilitating collaboration among us. Once the existing conditions were completed, we were able to phase the project in REVIT before uploading it to Navisworks, where we established our 4D and 5D schedule. Simultaneously, we prepared 2D plans (sections, elevations, plan views) in REVIT, using Twinmotion for 3D renderings and images that we would use during presentations to the client. Finally, for the innovation aspect, we decided to create a marker-based virtual reality application. In this application, you could view different images/plans of the project and also visualize the building in augmented reality, removing certain parts to see the interior and changing the materials of certain elements to assist in the final architectural decision-making. This application was interesting because, for example, it would have been possible to place a QR code, enabling installation, on a bench or table near the existing building, allowing people to directly visualize what the building would look like. One could even envision a polling system allowing people to choose different finishes based on what they saw in the app.

> Skills i learned

During this project, I learned to collaborate and manage collaboration with my various colleagues. I also enhanced my skills in the different software applications, namely REVIT, Twinmotion, and Navisworks. Lastly, I had to find an innovative solution to a posed problem and created an augmented reality application from scratch using Unity, allowing me to develop foundational knowledge in that area.
