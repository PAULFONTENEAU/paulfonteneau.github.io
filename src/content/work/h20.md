Embark on a humble exploration of my role as a BIM modeler in the Courchevel hotel project. Using Revit, I delicately shaped a 3D narrative, paying meticulous attention to the hotel's intricate pathways. Beyond doors, I contributed subtle nuances to enhance the project's charm.

In the spirit of understated proficiency, I tailored various families, focusing on discreet elements that added depth to the design. Operational finesse came into play with automated schedules and quantities for essentials like floors and ceilings—contributing quietly to the project's efficiency.

Amid this journey, I gently brought the project to life with unassuming renderings, providing a modest glimpse into the envisioned aesthetics.

On the practical side, I quietly translated the design into pragmatic on-site plans—simple yet effective guides for the construction team.

Dive into my portfolio to explore the unassuming elegance of the Courchevel Hotel project—a testament to the subtle impact of BIM.
