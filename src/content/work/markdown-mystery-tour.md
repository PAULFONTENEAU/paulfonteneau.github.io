This project focused on a formwork phasing with rotation. The goal was to achieve an automatic day-by-day phasing in REVIT for the walls/slabs that needed to be cast, as well as for the formwork and extensions used, hence an automatic nomenclature. Simultaneously, we had to colorize and create an automatic nomenclature for various types of walls based on their thicknesses

  On this blueprint, we can see walls and slabs who will be buil on the day 8 and 9
